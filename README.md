# Password Generator

## Description 

The goal of this project was to create a function to generate a random password, allowing the user to select the parameters. 

I learned how to use arrays to store data that can be accessed by functions. I also learned how to use the Math.random function to choose random elements from an array. 

I learned how to use if statements to check if certain conditions are met, and run the correct code to match the conditions. 

## Usage

To use the [password generator](https://ajpupping.github.io/password-generator/), visit the website and click the "generate password" button. Enter the desired number of characters, and select the desired types of characters from the prompts. The password will display in the main box on the page.
